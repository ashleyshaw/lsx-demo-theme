This means you should add standard config files to help with code consistency and tooling. For a WordPress JS project, suggest these:

- `.editorconfig` (editor settings)
- `.eslintrc.js` (you already have this for linting)
- `.prettierrc` (for code formatting)
- `package.json` (npm scripts and dependencies)
- `.npmignore` or `.gitignore` (ignore files for npm or git)
- `LICENSE` and `README.md` (for distribution/documentation)

You can ask CodeRabbit if any are missing or need updates. If you want, I can generate example contents for any of these files.

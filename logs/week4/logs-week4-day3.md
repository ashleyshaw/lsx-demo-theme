## Daily Standup

### How do you feel today?

Describe your overall mood or energy level.  For example: “Feeling excited to start working on the project.”

### What did you do yesterday?

Summarise what you accomplished in the previous session.  Mention specific tasks or issues you worked on.

### What do you plan to do today?

List the tasks you intend to work on today.  Use a checklist to break them down:

- [ ] Replace this line with an actual task; keep descriptions short and action‑oriented.
- [ ] Add more tasks as needed.

### What are your blockers?

Identify anything that might prevent you from making progress (e.g. waiting for feedback, unsure about a tool).  If you have no blockers, state “None”.

## Daily Logs

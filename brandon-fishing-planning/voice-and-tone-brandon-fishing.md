## **📣 Voice & Tone (recap, page by page)**

* **Homepage:** energetic, passionate, adventurous.

* **About:** personal storytelling, first-person perspective, “this is my journey.”

* **Fish (CPT archive):** clear, informative, visual; almost like a guidebook.

* **Blog:** casual, conversational, friendly — Brandon talking to a mate.

* **Contact:** short, human, “Drop me a note, I’ll get back soon.”

---

## **⚖️ Style Rules & Tone Sliders**

* ZA English, short sentences (8–18 words).

* Tone sliders: **Casual, Playful, Plain, Energetic, Educational**.

* Accessibility: high contrast for text, alt text for every fish photo.

* SEO: write for humans, use species names naturally, descriptive slugs (`/fish/smallmouth-yellowfish/`).

👉 With this, Brandon’s site would feel **authentic, grounded in place, and welcoming**, while still structured enough for discoverability and ease of use.

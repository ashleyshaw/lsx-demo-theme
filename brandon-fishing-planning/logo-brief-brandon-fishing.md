---

### **Purpose**

Create a **personal yet professional logo** that reflects Brandon’s passion for fishing in Huttenspruit, KwaZulu-Natal. The logo should be versatile across digital and print (website, social profiles, merch, maybe even stickers).

---

### **Style & Mood**

-   **Friendly, warm, human** — matches Brandon’s storytelling voice.

-   **Adventure-driven** — evokes being outdoors, riverbanks, and the excitement of fishing.

-   **Grounded in place** — draw inspiration from the natural colours and textures of KZN (greens, river blues, warm rock tones).

-   **Clean & simple** — must scale well from favicon size to banners.

---

### **Visual Elements**

-   **Fish silhouette or line art** — simple but recognisable.

-   Optional **river / water flow / hook motif** — adds motion and context.

-   **Nature-inspired shapes** — avoid overly sharp or corporate-looking geometry.

---

### **Colour Palette**

-   **River blue/green** — for freshness and water connection.

-   **Olive or muted green** — reflects vegetation.

-   **Warm grey/sandy beige** — natural rock tones.

-   **Accent:** Burnt orange/ochre for CTAs or highlights.

---

### **Typography**

-   **Headings / Logo wordmark:** Bold sans-serif (adventurous, modern) OR rustic serif (outdoorsy, authentic).

-   **Supporting tagline (if used):** Lighter sans-serif, clean and readable.

---

### **Usage**

-   **Primary logo:** Symbol \+ wordmark.

-   **Secondary logo:** Symbol-only version for small use cases (favicon, profile pic).

-   **Monochrome version:** For embossing or single-colour print.

---

### **Deliverables**

-   Full-colour vector logo (AI/SVG).

-   Monochrome and reversed versions.

-   PNG exports with transparent background (multiple sizes).

-   Brand colour codes \+ font recommendations.

---

👉 This brief ensures Brandon’s logo is **recognisable, flexible, and aligned with his personal fishing adventures**.

# **Dark Version**

![][image2]

I’ve generated a **dark version of Brandon’s logo**, designed to work on darker backgrounds.

### **Recommendations for Use**

-   **Backgrounds:** Deep navy, charcoal, or forest green.

-   **Logo colours:** Use light beige or warm sand tones for text and fish illustration, with burnt orange for the tagline to keep contrast strong.

-   **Applications:** Great for website footers, business cards, T-shirts, or any place where the background isn’t light.

-   **Variants to prepare:**

    -   Full logo with tagline (primary).

    -   Logo only, no tagline (secondary).

    -   Symbol-only mark (fish illustration).

Would you like me to **create a full dark-theme logo pack** (SVG \+ PNG in multiple sizes, with and without tagline) so you’ve got it ready for web and print use?

I’ve created a **dark background version** of Brandon’s logo with the tagline.

### **Key Details**

-   **Background**: Deep navy / charcoal, optimised for use on dark surfaces.

-   **Main Text**: Warm beige (for strong readability).

-   **Fish Illustration**: River blue accent.

-   **Tagline**: Burnt orange for contrast and warmth.

-   **Tagline used**: _“Stories from the river, catches for a lifetime.”_

This version is suitable for **website footers, merchandise, or social banners** where the background is dark.

Would you like me to now package **both light and dark logo variants** (SVG \+ PNG, multiple sizes, with/without tagline) into a **logo asset kit** for Brandon’s project?

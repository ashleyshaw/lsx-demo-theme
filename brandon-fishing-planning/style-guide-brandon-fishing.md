# **Style Guide**

Here‚Äôs how you could define Brandon‚Äôs **colours, typography, and style** for the fishing website, rooted in the Huttenspruit/KwaZulu-Natal context:

---

## **üé® Colours**

Pick a palette from the natural environment:

-   **River & Water:** muted deep blue or green-blue (for headings/accents).

-   **Rocks & Sand:** warm greys and sandy beige (for backgrounds and dividers).

-   **Vegetation:** olive or muted green (secondary accents, hover states).

-   **Sunset/Adventure:** a touch of burnt orange or ochre (CTA buttons, highlights).

Keep it earthy, not glossy ‚Äî echoing the real outdoor setting.

---

## **‚úçÔ∏è Typography**

-   **Headings:** bold, modern sans-serif (e.g. Montserrat, Inter, or Source Sans). Clean, easy to read.

-   **Body text:** humanist sans-serif or a serif with warmth (e.g. Lora, Merriweather). Comfortable for longer reading.

-   **Accents/Quotes:** italic serif or lighter weight for storytelling vibe.

Hierarchy:

-   H1 \= clear, adventurous tone (‚ÄúCatch the story. Relive the moment.‚Äù).

-   H2/H3 \= straightforward, informative.

-   Paragraphs \= short, easy to scan.

---

## **üñºÔ∏è Style**

-   **Imagery:** full-width, high-quality fishing/adventure photos. Mix of action shots (Brandon fishing) and close-ups (fish species).

-   **Shapes:** natural edges, maybe subtle rounded corners (avoid hard tech-like lines).

-   **Layout:** clean grid, white/neutral backgrounds, colour pops only where useful (CTA buttons, species tags).

-   **Icons:** simple line-based icons (e.g. location pins, fish icons, waves) for quick scanning.

-   **Species pages:** include cards with photo, short description, location markers.

Here‚Äôs a polished **one-page brand style guide image** for Brandon‚Äôs Fishing Adventures.

It includes:

-   **Logo & tagline** at the top.

-   **Colour swatches** with hex codes (river blue, olive green, warm grey).

-   **Typography** section (headings, body, accents).

-   **Voice & tone** description (friendly, personal, human, warm).

This works as a **ready reference** for designers, developers, or content writers.

üëâ Would you like me to now extend this into a **print-ready PDF brand sheet** with the logo variants, swatches, and usage rules, so Brandon has something he can hand to collaborators?

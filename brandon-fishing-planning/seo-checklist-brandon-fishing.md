# **SEO checklist**

Hereâ€™s a **basic SEO checklist** you can run through for Brandonâ€™s fishing site using **Yoast SEO**:

---

### **1\. Technical setup**

* Ensure only **one H1 per page** (Yoast will flag duplicates).

* Add **title and meta description** for each page/post.

* Use **clean, descriptive URLs** (`/fish/smallmouth-yellowfish/`, `/blog/fishing-trip-huttenspruit/`).

* Submit an **XML sitemap** via Yoast â†’ Search Appearance.

* Connect site to **Google Search Console**.

---

### **2\. Content optimisation**

* **Primary keyword** in H1, early H2, and naturally in first 100 words.

* Write **meta descriptions** (150â€“160 chars) that encourage clicks.

* Use **alt text** for every image (species name, location, context).

* Internal links:

  * Blog â†’ Fish species pages.

  * Fish â†’ Blog posts where those species are caught.

---

### **3\. Structure & readability**

* Short paragraphs (2â€“3 sentences).

* Use headings (H2/H3) for scannability.

* Apply **readability checks** in Yoast (aim green bullets).

* ZA English, active voice, friendly tone (as you outlined earlier).

---

### **4\. Blog posts**

* Each post should target **one keyword/topic** (e.g., *yellowfish Huttenspruit*).

* Include **location-based terms** where relevant (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa).

* Add **internal links** to Fish CPT and About page.

---

### **5\. Images & media**

* Optimise image filenames: `smallmouth-yellowfish-huttenspruit.jpg`.

* Compress images for speed.

* Use **descriptive captions** where useful.

---

### **6\. Ongoing**

* Review **Yoast SEO analysis** per post/page (aim for green lights, but donâ€™t force it).

* Keep updating blog content with **fresh stories** â€” search engines reward recency.

* Track performance in Google Search Console: impressions, clicks, queries.

* Check site speed (PageSpeed Insights) and accessibility regularly.

---

ðŸ‘‰ This is a **minimum viable SEO setup** â€” lightweight, practical, and aligned with Brandonâ€™s personal/adventure site.

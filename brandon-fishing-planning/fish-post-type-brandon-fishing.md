# **Fish Custom Post Type**

About the _types of fish Brandon fishes for_ (rather than each individual catch), then the structure can be much simpler and more “guide-like”. Here’s a streamlined definition:

---

## **🎣 Custom Post Type: Fish**

Each entry \= **one fish species/type** (e.g. Smallmouth Yellowfish, Tigerfish, Largemouth Bass).
 This will be more like a **field guide** than a logbook.

---

## **📝 Suggested Fields for Single Fish Template**

-   **Featured Image** — large header image of the species.

-   **Gallery** — optional, e.g. habitat shots or multiple angles.

-   **Description** — main body text about the fish.

-   **Habitat / Locations** (text or taxonomy, e.g. Huttenspruit, Tugela River, Drakensberg streams).

-   **Fishing Season** (text or select field — best times of year).

-   **Average Size** (numeric, cm or kg, or just text).

-   **Preferred Bait / Lure** (short text).

-   **Conservation Status** (dropdown: common, protected, threatened).

-   **Fun Fact** (short text, optional — keeps it engaging and personal).

---

## **📐 Template Layout**

1. **Hero section:** Featured image with species name as H1.

2. **Intro section:** short description, conservation note, key facts in a highlighted box.

3. **Gallery section:** optional extra photos.

4. **Details section:** habitat, season, bait, size.

5. **Content/story section:** Brandon’s personal note or fishing experience with this species.

6. **Related fish:** link to other fish CPT entries (by taxonomy, e.g. “Other river fish”).

## **⚖️ Benefits of Keeping It Simple**

-   Easier to maintain (fewer fields per species).

-   Readers get an at-a-glance “guidebook” feel.

-   Keeps space open for Brandon’s personal storytelling while still being informative.

👉 This balances **informative content (field guide)** with **Brandon’s voice (personal experience)**.
